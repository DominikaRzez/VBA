# VBA-challenge
This repository contains the VBA scripts allowing to anaylze the stock market data in the Multiple_year_stock_data file.

Within the attached files you can find 4 seperate VBA scirpts:
- Summary_table_script.vba creates a loop through all the stocks for one year and output the summary table containing the ticker symbol, yearly change from openning price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year and the total stock volume;
- Conditional_formatting.vba file contains the VBA script that applies formatting to the yearly changes columns that highlights the positive change in green and negative change in red;
- Bonus.vba is a script that returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume";
- The last file, Completed_Script.vba is a combination of all the scripts above. It is also adjusted, so it allows the code to run on every worksheet automatically by just running the VBA script once.

In the files you can also find 3 pictures of the results for each year on the Mutli Year Stock Data.
